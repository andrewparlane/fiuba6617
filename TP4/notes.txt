    passes?
Video
    resolution
        640*480@60Hz
            single buffered - 307,200 bits
            double buffered - 614,400 bits
            clock: 25MHz
    options
        1) single buffereed in BRAM
           clear and rewrite all during blanking ~1.76mS
           12,000 co-ords read + 3*cordic + written
           = new value written every 146nS -> clk 6MHz
           probably doable
        2) Double buffered in SRAM / SDRAM
           would need to be able to guarantee pixel data is ready
           so probably have to read X rows of pixel data to a buffer
           while writing cordic results to a buffer.
           Then write codic data to RAM, then read more pixels
           etc...
        3) Don't worry about it, the updates will look like shit
           while rotating

RAMs
----
    BRAM
        430,080 bits + 53,760 parity bits
    SDRAM - U17 - 1M*16*4
        IS42S16400D-7TL
        speed 7ns - 143MHz
        8MB
    SRAM - U18 - 256K*16
        IS61LV25616AL-10T
        512KB
        pretty simple interface
        read at 100MHz
        write at 100MHz (probably)

Clocks
------
    VGA
        25MHz
    SRAM
        max 100MHz

Plan
----
    enter stage 1
    UART writes data to SRAM
    enter stage 2
    loop at 50Hz
        start pipeline
            read coordinates
            cordic1
            cordic2
            cordic3
            convert to 2D
            write to BRAM
